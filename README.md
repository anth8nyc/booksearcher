# Google Books Reading List READme


## Description
This MERN stack site application allows users to search the Google Books API to then save the individual entiries they are interested in to a reading list. The application accomplishes this by saving search results that are rendered through a react state to a MongoDB database. The API routes allow for both saving and deleting to the MongoDB database.

Books can be searched on the search page, and are simply saved by selecting "Save" on result entries. To view and delete unwanted saved books, the 'My Books' page allows for either.
